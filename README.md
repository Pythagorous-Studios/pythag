# pythag
A rudimentary engine for making text based adventure games in python

This project will remain in early alpha form indefinitely as devolopment has shifted to a fork
with a heavier focus on rpg and board game like elements. It's successor,pythag-quest will recieve all new features
from this point forward,which may be *eventually* backported one day to pythag-core.
